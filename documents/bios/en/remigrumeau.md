Full stack developer, i like to code various things as JS, CSS, PHP and even Arduino.
Happy co-founder of a digital studio focused on websites & webapps for mobiles & tablets
I started Javascript when VBScript was still around too
and looking forward to fully switch from PHP to Node in a near future
